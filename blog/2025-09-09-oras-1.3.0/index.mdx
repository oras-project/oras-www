The ORAS community is thrilled to announce the ORAS CLI v1.3.0, a release packed with stability upgrades and pioneering capabilities. Beyond strengthening existing core functionality, this version introduces three major new features designed to elevate your artifact and registry management workflows:
<!-- truncate -->

1. **Portable backup & restore of repositories and artifacts**
2. **Multi-platform image and artifact management**
3. **Rich formatted output for scripting and pipelines**

Moreover, ORAS is now fully compliant with OCI [distribution-spec v1.1.1](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/releases/tag/v1.1.1).

## Your Registry’s Safety Net: Portable Backup & Restore

With `oras backup` and `oras restore`, ORAS now lets you save your registry content into local directories or tarballs (OCI image layout format) as a snapshot and **restore to any registry**. All manifests and optionally any tags, referrers will be included within the backup.

Use cases include:

- **Air-Gapped Environments**: Organizations operating in isolated or high-security environments can use `oras backup` to export artifacts from a registry to local filesystem, and use `oras restore` to import them into an internal registry with restricted access.
- **Disaster Recovery and Audit Archival**: Take periodic snapshots of repositories and store them off-site. In case of accidental deletions, outages, and long-term storage to support regulatory audits, `oras restore` can be used to quickly recover full registry content.
- **Registry Migration**: When moving from one container registry provider to another, the pair of commands enables a full repository export, preserving tags, manifests, layers, and referrers.
- **Compliance and supply chain security guarantee**: Backup and restore the images along with their supply chain artifacts, such as SBOMs, signatures, vulnerability scanning reports.
- **Repository Duplication or Promotion**: Move artifacts from dev to staging to prod registries reliably using an intermediate backup file.

## Multi-platform Image and Artifact Management

Multi-platform images are commonly used in IoT and Edge computing, particularly heterogeneous deployments. In addition, OpenTofu or Terraform modules are packed as platform-specific artifacts and stored as multi-platform artifact in OCI registries. Thanks to our community partner OpenTofu, now multi-platform artifact management is introduced in v1.3.0.

With `oras manifest index create` and `oras manifest index update`, you can easily assemble, update, distribute, and annotate multi-architecture images and artifacts across local environments and registries. Check out the user guide <Link to="/docs/how_to_guides/multiarch">Create and Manage Multi-architecture Artifacts</Link> for details.

## Enable Scripting and Automation: Formatted Output 

In automation pipelines, the difference between human-readable and machine-usable output can be the difference between clarity and chaos.

With this release, ORAS enables users to use the `--format` flag to format metadata output into structured data (e.g. JSON) and optionally use the `--template` flag with the [Go template language](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template). This has been enabled for commands like `pull`, `push`, `attach`, `discover`, and `manifest fetch` with support for output formats including JSON, Go templates, trees, and tables. You can even run computations with Sprig template functions as well.

- Use `--format <DATA_FORMAT>` to transform the output of ORAS commands into different formats including prettified JSON, tree, table view, and Go template, i.e. `--format json|tree|table|go-template=GO_TEMPLATE`. 
- Use `--template GO_TEMPLATE` to compute and manipulate the output using Go templates based on the chosen data format. 

Formatted output transforms ORAS from a simple terminal user tool to a **DevOps-friendly, integrable** developer tool. Check out the user guide <Link to="/docs/how_to_guides/format_output">Formatted output</Link> for details.

## Stability & User Experience Polish

This release also includes a number of enhancements that provides a better overall user experience and stability.

* **Feature Stability Promotions**: `oras attach`, `oras pull --include-subject`, and more are now `Stable`. `oras resolve` from `Experimental` to `Preview`.
* **Discover UX**: `oras discover` now displays referrers recursively by default; The maximum recursion depth can be controlled via the --depth flag
* **Loong64 support**: More platform options including [loong64](https://wiki.debian.org/Ports/loong64) open for users.
* **Developer experience**: Enhanced clarity within error messages, debugging logs, and a number of documentation updates.

## Why This Release Matters

Whether you're looking to backup and restore entire registries, publish multi-architecture bundles, or integrate ORAS into CI/CD pipelines, v1.3.0 brings the tools and the end-to-end artifact management solutions you need.

* **Platform teams** gain robust disaster recovery and migration tooling.
* **DevOps engineers** get the multi-arch flexibility needed for heterogeneous infrastructure.
* **CI/CD and platform builders** enjoy structured data outputs for reliable, scriptable workflows.
* **Maintainers** ship safer, cleaner, and more future-proof artifact workflows.

There are a few bug fixes and a deprecated feature in this release. For a concrete changelog, please see the [ORAS v1.3.0 Release Notes](https://github.com/oras-project/oras/releases/tag/v1.3.0).
