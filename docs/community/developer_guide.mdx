# Developer Guide

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+
- Git
- Make

## Clone the Repository

Once you have the basic tools installed, fork the repository on GitHub and clone it locally:
```bash
MY_GITHUB_NAME="my-name"
git clone git@github.com:${MY_GITHUB_NAME}/oras.git
cd oras
```

## Building the Binary

To compile and run the tests, just run the `make` command.
Use `make build` to build all platform binaries to the `bin/` directory.

Mac:

```bash
# builds to
# - bin/darwin/amd64/oras
# - bin/darwin/arm64/oras
make build-mac

# builds to bin/darwin/amd64/oras
make build-mac-amd64

# builds to bin/darwin/arm64/oras
make build-mac-arm64
```

Linux:

```bash
# builds to
# - bin/linux/arm64/oras
# - bin/linux/amd64/ora
# - bin/linux/arm/v7/orass
make build-linux

# builds to bin/linux/arm64/oras
make build-linux-arm64

# builds to bin/linux/amd64/oras
make build-linux-amd64

# builds to bin/linux/arm/v7/oras
make build-linux-arm-v7
```

Windows:

```bash
# builds to bin/windows/amd64/oras.exe
make build-windows
```

## Cleaning Your Workspace

To remove all files not manged by git, run `make clean` (be careful!)

## Managing Dependencies

[Using Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) to manage dependencies.

To update or add new dependencies, run `go get <package name>`.

## Release Checklist

:::info

This section needs a lot of love and automation 🙂

:::
### Prerequisites
1. Make sure your GPG is available on GitHub at `https://github.com/<username>.gpg`. This can be added at https://github.com/settings/keys.
    -  If you haven't already, open a PR to add your GPG key to the [`KEYS`](https://github.com/oras-project/oras/blob/main/KEYS) file (see file for instructions).
1. Open a bump PR to build with the latest golang: replace go version of the [binary](https://github.com/oras-project/oras/blob/main/.github/workflows/release-github.yml#L32) and [image](https://github.com/oras-project/oras/blob/main/Dockerfile#L14) to match the latest stable version. Skippable if the latest version is already used.
1. (patch-release-only) Cherry-pick or backport the fix commits to the patch release branch. Make sure applicable critical and high CVE patches are on the release branch.

### Request to vote and merge
1. Open a PR to update the `oras` version: replace the [current version](https://github.com/oras-project/oras/blob/main/internal/version/version.go#L20) with the upcoming release version.
    - The target branch is:
        - `main` if releasing a new version.
        - `release-<major>.<minor>` if releasing a patch.
    - The title should be `bump: tag and release ORAS CLI v<major>.<minor>.<patch>[-<pre-release>]`.
    - The description must reference the digest of version bump up commit for voting.
1. Send a message to the ORAS slack channel to call for a vote on the release PR.
    - The target commit should be the SHA digest of the last commit in the release PR
1. If the vote PR has a super-majority of approval from ORAS maintainers, then the PR could be merged into the target branch.
    - Make sure that
        - the PR is merged with `Create a merge commit` option.
        - the merge commit title should be generated by Github.
        - the merge commit message should be the signoff info.
1. (optional) Cut off a release branch named `release-<major>.<minor>` on the tagged commit **ONLY** when releasing a new minor version.

### Release
1. Make a fresh clone of the [repo](https://github.com/oras-project/oras) after all above steps are completed. Create a new tag for the version prefixed with "v" and push the tag directly to the repo. The tag should be created on the voted commit, **NOT** the merge commit.
    ```sh
    version=1.0.0
    digest=b58e7b910ca556973d111e9bd734a71baef03db2 # replace with the digest of the voted commit
    git tag v${version} $digest
    ```
    After validating the tag is created on the voted commit, push the created tag:
    ```sh
    git push origin v${version}
    ```
1. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete successfully for both the `release-ghcr` and `release-github` pipelines.
1. Download all of the artifacts uploaded to the new GitHub release locally (`*checksums.txt`, `*darwin_amd64.tar.gz`, `*linux_armv7.tar.gz`, `*linux_arm64.tar.gz`, `*linux_amd64.tar.gz`, `*windows_amd64.zip`).
1. Verify the checksum of the file, downloaded platform should pass the check:
    ```sh
    shasum -c oras_${version}_checksums.txt
    ```
1. Run `oras version` command and make sure that version number and git commit digest is the expected value (same as the commit used to create the tag). Example:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p oras-bin/
    tar -zxf oras_${version}_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C oras-bin
    ./oras-bin/oras version
    ```

1. Create armored GPG signatures(`.asc`) using the key in the `KEYS` file.
    ```sh
    for file in `ls`; do
        gpg --armor --detach-sign $file
    done
    ```
1. Validate the signatures. Note that the `KEYS` file should be imported with `gpg --import KEYS`. Run some form of the following (adapted from Linux project):
    ```sh
    for file in `ls *.asc`; do
        gpg --verify $file
    done
    ```
1. Click the "Edit release" button on the release, and add the `.asc` files created in the previous step. Edit the release description to include change logs and a note indicating the releaser's GPG key used to sign the artifacts. See an example:
    ```
    ## Notes

    This release was signed with `46D3 369B 393F 6F82 71FD 1CE8 F86E C70D 2B0C 404F` (@qweeah's GPG key) which can be found [here](https://github.com/qweeah.gpg).
    ```
    The uploaded signatures and GPG key will be used for [binary validation](https://oras.land/docs/how_to_guides/verifying_binaries).
1. Click "Publish Release" button to save. Double-check that the release contains a corresponding `.asc` file for each release artifact.
1. Consume beverage of choice.. you're done! Thanks for moving the project forward.
1. Oh yea, tell people about it in the `#oras` slack channel.
    
### Some Comments

There is a large number of steps here, mostly manual. Here are some comments and/or thoughts on it.

* Step 3: Editing files for stable version. I can see that in one place, say, `README.md`. But do we really have to edit the code? Could we not use build-time flags as in `go build -ldflags="-X main.Version=foo"` or similar?
* Step 6: This is the heart of the release. Adding a tag triggers a github release and an image build pushed to GHCR.
* Steps 7-13: These are all signing and verifying. Of course, it is possible that GH Actions built and released something other than what we thought, but we cannot counter every single possible risk. It still would be nice if we could automate this somehow.
* Step 15: :beer:

From a documentation perspective, I would break this down into sections:

1. Prepare the release.
2. Cut the release.
3. Verify the release (hopefully automated).
4. Sign the release.
5. Make available elsewhere (hopefully automated).

Once ready, this should be a doc in the project itself.

### Library vs Utility

oras actually serves 2 purposes: library and utility. All of the above steps, except for the tag, are entirely about the utility.

For better or for worse, semver is tied up with both. As an example, the current issue with the go modules solely affects its inclusion as a library, but it is immediate. It can be fixed by cutting v1.0.0, and the downstream problems go away. yet cutting a release _also_ means all of the above, which are far more complicated.
