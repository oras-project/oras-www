# Distributing OCI Layouts

The directory structure for OCI content-addressable blobs and location-addressable references (refs) is called the [OCI Image Layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-layout.md). An OCI Image needs to include:

- `blobs` directory: Each hash algorithm's directory and its children, which make up the object names in the blobs subdirectories, will hold the real content.

- `oci-layout` file: This JSON object indicates the base of an Open Container Image Layout and provides information about the current image-layout version.

- `index.json` file: The image index is a multi-descriptor entry point.

## Creating an OCI Image 

### Step 1: Writing in the Dockerfile

Put the following commands in the `Dockerfile` in order to run an image of Alpine Linux.

```
FROM alpine
CMD echo 'hello world!'
```

Our image is based on alpine and runs the command `echo hello world!`.

### Step 2: Building the image using docker

```
docker buildx create —use
```

This command is used to create a new instance of a builder with a single node based on the current configuration.


```
docker buildx build . -f Dockerfile -o type=oci,dest=hello-world.tar -t hello-world:v1
```

Expected output:
```
[+] Building 7.0s (7/7) FINISHED                 docker-container:hungry_wilson
 => [internal] booting buildkit                                            3.0s
 => => pulling image moby/buildkit:buildx-stable-1                         2.5s
 => => creating container buildx_buildkit_hungry_wilson0                   0.5s

 => => exporting config sha256:5e9872dc690060c52e4ea6e9357aaebb9d9187b44a  0.0s
 => => sending tarball                                                     0.0s
```

This command has multiple parts to break down:

`build` is needed to build the OCI Image based on the Dockerfile we provide.
hello-world:v1 is the name and tag associated with the image built.

| Flag         | Description                                          |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| file or -f   | Name of the Dockerfile (default: PATH/Dockerfile)    |
| output or -o | Output destination (format: type=local,dest=path)    |

### Step 3: View the OCI Image

If you would like to view the image, you will need to extract the `.tar` file first.

```
mkdir hello-world
tar -xf ./hello-world.tar -C hello-world
```

## Push the OCI Image to a Repository

You may use [`oras copy`](../commands/oras_copy.mdx) to push the OCI Image from your local disk to a repository.

In the following example, we are pushing the image to a local registry like zot:

```
oras cp --from-oci-layout ./hello-world.tar:v1 localhost:5000/hello-artifact:v1
``` 

Expected output:

```
Copied [oci-layout] ./hello-world.tar:v1 => [registry] localhost:5000/hello-artifact:v1
Digest: sha256:3fd491e6dc3ce66cae989d23b3f3d5752314cd1793d0c580d3fd8bb280d07809
```

## Pull the OCI Image from a Repository

You can pull the OCI image using the [`oras pull`](../commands/oras_pull.mdx) command.

```
oras pull localhost:5000/hello-artifact:v1
```

Expected Output:

```
Downloaded empty artifact
Pulled [registry] localhost:5000/hello-artifact:v1
Digest: sha256:3fd491e6dc3ce66cae989d23b3f3d5752314cd1793d0c580d3fd8bb280d07809
```

If you would like to access the artifact files from the OCI layout archive, you may run:

```
oras pull --oci-layout hello-world.tar:v1
```

Expected Output:

```
Downloaded empty artifact
Pulled [oci-layout] hello-world.tar:v1
Digest: sha256:3fd491e6dc3ce66cae989d23b3f3d5752314cd1793d0c580d3fd8bb280d07809
```
