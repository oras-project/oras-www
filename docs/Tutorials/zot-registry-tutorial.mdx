# Tutorial to Install Zot Registry and Distribute OCI Artifacts to Zot Registry using ORAS CLI

Before we tackle how to distribute an OCI artifact to an OCI registry, let us first take a look at what we mean by distributing OCI artifacts, why we need it and what OCI registries are. 

OCI registries are like a single location where container images are stored and made available to everyone. Distributing OCI artifacts refers to when artifacts are pushed to these registries. These artifacts can then be pulled (or retrieved) by someone else and used in their environments. These images often help with packaging and distributing software applications.

We will be using zot registry in this guide. Zot registry is an OCI-native container registry for distributing container images and OCI artifacts.

In order to follow the steps given, you would be required to install ORAS CLI. You can follow the [installation guide](https://oras.land/docs/CLI/installation) to do so.

### Phase 1: To Install Zot Registry

We will be covering 2 methods of installation in this tutorial. 

#### Method 1: Using docker

Prerequisites for this method:
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 

```
docker run -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/project-zot/zot-linux-amd64:latest
```

```
Unable to find image 'ghcr.io/project-zot/zot-linux-amd64:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from project-zot/zot-linux-amd64
a7ca0d9ba68f: Pull complete 
fe5ca62666f0: Pull complete

after":"2h0m0s","goroutine":24,"caller":"zotregistry.io/zot/pkg/extensions/extension_search.go:160","time":"2023-05-20T10:50:45.892076536Z"}
{"level":"debug","component":"scheduler","worker":3,"goroutine":24,"caller":"zotregistry.io/zot/pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go:105","time":"2023-05-20T10:50:45.892089946Z","message":"scheduler: finished task"}
```

#### Method 2: Using a Kubernetes cluster and helm

Prerequisites for this phase:
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (alternatives: podman or a virtualization tool like VirtualBox)
* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) (alternatives: kubeadm)

If you would like to install zot registry on Bare Metal Linux, you could follow their [installation guide](https://zotregistry.io/v1.4.3/install-guides/install-guide-linux/).

**Step 1: Create a Kubernetes cluster using minikube.**

```
minikube start
```

The output should look similar to this if you were successful in creating one:

```
😄  minikube v1.30.1 on Ubuntu 22.04
✨  Using the docker driver based on existing profile
👍  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
🚜  Pulling base image ...
🏃  Updating the running docker "minikube" container ...
❗  This container is having trouble accessing https://registry.k8s.io
💡  To pull new external images, you may need to configure a proxy: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/networking/proxy/
🐳  Preparing Kubernetes v1.26.3 on Docker 23.0.2 ...
🔎  Verifying Kubernetes components...
    ▪ Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5
🌟  Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass
🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
```

**Step 2: Specify a remote repository that contains the Helm charts for zot.**

```
helm repo add project-zot http://zotregistry.io/helm-charts
```

```
"project-zot" has been added to your repositories
```

**Step 3: Update to the latest information of available charts from the chart repository, as shown below:**

```
helm repo update project-zot
```

```
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "project-zot" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
```

You can use `helm show all project-zot/zot` to view the default information of the project. 

To follow this tutorial, we do not need to make any changes to the default values. But, if you would like to see the configurable settings, run `helm show values project-zot/zot`. You can find more information on how to customize the Helm chart using `set` or a file through the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/).

**Step 4: Install zot**

```
helm install zot project-zot/zot
```

If you have successfully installed zot, you can expect a similar output:

```
NAME: zot
LAST DEPLOYED: Sat May 20 15:50:22 2023
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
Get the application URL by running these commands:
  export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace default -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services zot)
  export NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes --namespace default -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}")
  echo http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT
```

Step 5: To verify the installation

```
export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace default -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services zot)
export NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes --namespace default -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}")
echo http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT
```

Your output may be different but it should look like this:
```
http://192.168.49.2:30276
```

### Phase 2: Distribution of OCI Artifacts to Zot Registry Using Oras CLI

Please open a new terminal window for the next phase.

**Note:** If you have used method 1 for the installation, you will need to replace the IP address and port with `localhost:5000`.

**Step 1: Create a sample file** 

```
echo "hello world" > artifact.txt
```

**Step 2: Authenticate with zot registry**

It is to be noted that in case of zot, authentication is disabled by default. Still, if you wish to authenticate, you can either use `docker login` or [`oras login`](https://oras.land/docs/CLI_Reference/oras_login) to do so.

**Step 3: Pushing artifacts to the zot repository**

```
oras push --plain-http 192.168.49.2:30276/hello-artifact:v1 \
        --artifact-type application/vnd.acme.rocket.config \
        artifact.txt:text/plain -d -v
```

In this command, we have used the output we got in step 5 of phase 1.

```
Uploading a948904f2f0f artifact.txt
Uploaded  a948904f2f0f artifact.txt
Pushed [registry] 192.168.49.2:30276/hello-artifact:v1
Digest: sha256:bcdd6799fed0fca0eaedfc1c642f3d1dd7b8e78b43986a89935d6fe217a09cee
```

After pushing the artifact, we can see them on the same link:

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJdQHUKSn.png)


**Step 4: Pulling artifacts from the zot repository**

```
oras pull --plain-http 192.168.49.2:30276/hello-artifact:v1 -d -v
```

```
DEBU[0000] > Request URL: "http://192.168.49.2:30276/v2/hello-artifact/manifests/v1" 
DEBU[0000] > Request method: "GET"                      
DEBU[0000] > Request headers: 

<!-- truncate -->

Downloaded  a948904f2f0f artifact.txt
Downloaded  bcdd6799fed0 application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json
Pulled [registry] 192.168.49.2:30276/hello-artifact:v1
Digest: sha256:bcdd6799fed0fca0eaedfc1c642f3d1dd7b8e78b43986a89935d6fe217a09cee
```

**Step 5: To attach files to an existing artifact**

First, let's create another sample file to add,

```
echo "hello world" > hi.txt
```

You can use the command below to attach `hi.txt` to the artifact we pushed above:

```
oras attach --plain-http --artifact-type doc/example 192.168.49.2:30276/hello-artifact:v1 hi.txt
```

```
Exists    a948904f2f0f hi.txt
Attached to [registry] 192.168.49.2:30276/hello-artifact@sha256:327db68f73d0ed53d528d927a6703c00739d7c1076e50762c3f6641b51b76fdc
Digest: sha256:bcdd6799fed0fca0eaedfc1c642f3d1dd7b8e78b43986a89935d6fe217a09cee
```

**Step 6: To check the referrers of the manifest in our zot registry**

```
oras discover --plain-http 192.168.49.2:30276/hello-artifact:v1
```

```
Discovered 1 artifact referencing v1
Digest: sha256:327db68f73d0ed53d528d927a6703c00739d7c1076e50762c3f6641b51b76fdc

Artifact Type   Digest
doc/example     sha256:bcdd6799fed0fca0eaedfc1c642f3d1dd7b8e78b43986a89935d6fe217a09cee
```

**Note:** We have used the flag `--plain-http` in the steps because we want to allow insecure connections to registry without SSL check.

### Conclusion

You can now successfully push OCI artifacts to your zot registry! 

Distributing OCI artifacts to OCI registries aids in collaboration and code sharing. It enables teams to acquire and use standardized container images. This is why it is considered to play a crucial role in maintaining consistency among teams.
