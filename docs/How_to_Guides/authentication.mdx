# Authentication

In order to push or pull artifacts or images to an OCI registry, we need to prove our identity using authentication. Following this, authorization provides the required permissions to the user.

In ORAS, we can use [`oras login`](../CLI_Reference/oras_login.mdx) in advance to authenticate ourselves for private registries. By default, this command stores the credentials in `~/.docker/config.json` (same file used by the docker client). If you have previously authenticated to a registry using `docker login`, the credentials will be reused.

You can use the `-c/â€“config` option to specify an alternate location.

:::info

While ORAS leverages the local docker client config store, ORAS does NOT have a dependency on Docker Desktop running or being installed. ORAS can be used independently of a local docker daemon.

:::

`oras` also accepts explicit credentials via options, for example,

```
oras pull -u username -p password myregistry.io/myimage:latest
```
**Note:** The drawback of the above method is that it requires you to authenticate for every command rather than once for multiple commands.   

See [Supported Registries] for registry specific authentication usage.
