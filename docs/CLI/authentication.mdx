# Authentication

Run `oras login` in advance for any private registries. By default, this will store credentials in `~/.docker/config.json` *(same file used by the docker client)*. If you have previously authenticated to a registry using `docker login`, the credentials will be reused.

Use the `-c`/`--config` option to specify an alternate location.

:::info

While ORAS leverages the local docker client config store, ORAS does NOT have a dependency on Docker Desktop running or being installed. ORAS can be used independently of a local docker daemon.

:::

`oras` also accepts explicit credentials via options, for example,

```
oras pull -u username -p password myregistry.io/myimage:latest
```

See [Supported Registries] for registry specific authentication usage.
