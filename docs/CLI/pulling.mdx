# Pulling

Pulling artifacts involves specifying the content addressable artifact, along with the type of artifact.

```
oras pull localhost:5000/hello-artifact:v2 -a
```

## Using cache when pulling artifacts

In order to save unnecessary network bandwidth and disk I/O oras should provides a solution to pull the artifacts into a local content-address storage (CAS) if the content does not exist, and then copy the artifact to the desired storage.

The cache directory is specified by using the environment variable `ORAS_CACHE`. If not specified, cache is not used.

```
# Set cache root
export ORAS_CACHE=~/.oras/cache
# Pull artifacts as usual
oras pull localhost:5000/hello:latest
```
