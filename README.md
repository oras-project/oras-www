# Development

## Online one-click setup

You can use Gitpod (a free, online, VS Code-like IDE) for contributing. With a single click, it will launch a workspace (for Docusaurus 2) automatically:

* clone the docusaurus repo.
* install the dependencies.
* run `npm start`

So that you can start contributing straight away.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/oras-project/oras-www)

## System Requirements

* [Node.js v16.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and above

## Installation

```script
npm install
```

## Local development

```script
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
The site will be available at http://localhost:3000/

## Build for production

```script
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service. For that purpose, you can also
use:

```script
npm run serve
```
