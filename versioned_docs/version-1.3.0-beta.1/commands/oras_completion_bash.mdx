# oras completion bash

Generate the autocompletion script for the bash shell.
This script depends on the 'bash-completion' package.
If it is not installed already, you can install it via your operating system package manager.
To load completions in your current shell session:
```bash
	source <(oras completion bash)
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:
## Linux:
```bash
	oras completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/oras
```

## macOS:
```bash
	oras completion bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/oras
```

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

## Options

```
  -h, --help              help for bash
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```
