# oras completion zsh

Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.
If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
to enable it.  You can execute the following once:
```bash
	echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

To load completions in your current shell session:
```bash
	source <(oras completion zsh)
```

To load completions for every new session, execute once:
## Linux:
```bash
oras completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_oras"
```

## macOS:
```bash
oras completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_oras
```

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

## Options

```
  -h, --help              help for zsh
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```
