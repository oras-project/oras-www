# Glossary

### Annotations

[Annotations](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md) are string key-value pairs similar to labels. 
Annotations are supported by OCI Image Manifest and OCI Content Descriptors. 
You can refer to our [how-to guide](./how_to_guides/manifest_annotations.mdx) to understand how ORAS CLI could be used to add them.

### Artifacts

Artifacts are a conceptual piece of content stored as [Blobs](#blob) with an accompanying Manifest containing a [Config](#config). 
We can [push](./commands/oras_push.mdx), 
[pull](./commands/oras_pull.mdx), 
[attach](./commands/oras_attach.mdx) artifacts using the ORAS CLI. 
In order to understand the usage better, 
you may follow the steps in our [quick start guide](./quickstart.mdx).

### Blob

Blob (which stands for Binary Large Objects) is the content stored by a registry and is addressable by a Digest. 
ORAS allows you to [fetch](./commands/oras_blob_fetch.mdx), 
[delete](./commands/oras_blob_delete.mdx) 
and [push](./commands/oras_blob_push.mdx) blobs.

### Config

[Config](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/config.md) is the JSON format describing images for use with a container runtime and execution tool and its relationship to filesystem changesets. 
You may use [`oras manifest fetch-config`](./commands/oras_manifest_fetch-config.mdx) to check out the config of your artifact.

### Container Images

A [container image](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/#:~:text=A%20Docker%20container%20image%20is,tools%2C%20system%20libraries%20and%20settings.) is a small, standalone, 
executable file that contains all the components required to run an application, 
including the code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.

### Content Descriptors

A [Content Descriptor](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/descriptor.md) (or simply Descriptor) describes the disposition of the targeted content. 
It includes the type of the content, 
a content identifier (digest), 
and the byte-size of the raw content. 
Optionally, it includes the type of artifact it is describing.

### Digest

A [digest](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/descriptor.md#digests) is a property of a Descriptor which uniquely identifies content by taking a collision-resistant hash of the bytes.

### Distribution-spec

The [OCI Distribution Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md) defines an API protocol to facilitate and standardize the distribution of content.

### Extensions

The Distribution Specification Project includes a process and API for prototyping and testing [extensions](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/extensions/README.md) to the Distribution API.

### Image Layout

The [OCI Image Layout](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-layout.md) is the directory structure for OCI content-addressable blobs and location-addressable references (refs). 
It must contain a `blobs` directory, `oci-layout` file and an `index.json` file. 
To learn more, check out the [how-to guide](./how_to_guides/distributing_oci_layouts.mdx) on OCI Layouts.

### Image Manifests

An [image manifest](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/manifest.md#image-manifest) provides a configuration and set of layers for a single container image for a specific architecture and operating system.

### Image-spec

The [OCI Image Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/spec.md) defines an OCI Image, 
consisting of an image manifest, 
an image index (optional), 
a set of filesystem layers, 
and a configuration.

### Image Index Specification

The [image index](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/image-index.md) is a higher-level manifest which points to specific image manifests, ideal for one or more platforms. 
It is a multi-descriptor entry point.

### Local Registry

A registry is a place where container images and artifacts can easily be stored and accessed. 
Whereas, a local registry (like [zot](https://zotregistry.dev/)) is a registry that is present on our local machine. 
You can follow our [quick start guide](./quickstart.mdx) if you would like to try using zot registry.

### Manifest Referrers API

Artifact-manifest provides the ability to reference artifacts to existing artifacts. Reference artifacts include signatures, 
SBoMs and many other types. 
The [manifest `referrers` API](https://github.com/oras-project/artifacts-spec/blob/main/manifest-referrers-api.md) returns all artifacts that have a `subject` of the given manifest digest.

### Referrer API

The Referrers API returns a list of manifests that reference a blob. 
You can understand how to use this API by referring to the [details](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md#listing-referrers) given in the distribution spec. 

### Referrer Tag Schema

The Referrer Tag Schema helps to pull the current list of referrers based on different digest formats or tags.

### Registry

A registry is like a central repository where you can store, share and manage container images and artifacts.

### Remote Registry

A remote registry is when our registry is remotely available such as Docker Hub, ghcr.io, etc. 
We can use ORAS CLI to perform many operations such as [pushing](./commands/oras_push.mdx), 
[pulling](./commands/oras_pull.mdx), 
[attaching](./commands/oras_attach.mdx) artifacts.

### Software Bill of Materials

A codebase's open source and third-party components are listed in a software Bill of Materials (SBOM). 
Additionally, an SBOM provides the versions of the components used in the codebase, 
their patch status, 
and the licences that govern them. 

### Supply Chain Security

Supply chain security emphasises risk management of outside vendors, suppliers, logistics, and transportation. 
It recognises, assesses, and reduces risks related to collaborating with other organisations as a part of your supply chain.

### Tags

Tags are used toÂ define keys and values and associate them with resources by adding metadata to resources.
