# oras completion

`oras completion` helps to generate the autocompletion script for oras for the specified shell.

Based on the shell that you use (bash/fish/powershell/zsh), please run:

```
oras completion [shell] --help
```

This will return an output on how you can set up `oras completion` for your shell.

For example, the following steps are to be followed to set it up for `zsh` on macOS:

```
$ echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
$ source <(oras completion zsh); compdef _oras oras
$ oras completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_oras
```

After setting it up, you can hit `tab` to autocomplete your commands.

## Options

```
  -h, --help                                            help for [shell]
      --no-descriptions                                 disable completion descriptions
```
