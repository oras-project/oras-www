# How to build ORAS CLI locally

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+
- Git
- Make

## Clone the Repository

Once you have the basic tools installed, fork the repository on GitHub and clone it locally:
```bash
MY_GITHUB_NAME="my-name"
git clone git@github.com:${MY_GITHUB_NAME}/oras.git
cd oras
```

## Running Tests

The default Makefile target will run the tests and build the architecture appropriate binary.

```bash
make
```

This command will:
- Run `go mod tidy` to ensure dependencies are up to date
- Run `go mod vendor` to vendor dependencies
- Check file encoding
- Execute all unit tests with race detection and generate a coverage report
- Build the binary for the current architecture

## Building the Binaries

Running `make build` will build all platform binaries to the `bin/` directory.
To compile and run the tests in one step, just run the `make` command.

Mac:

```bash
# builds to
# - bin/darwin/amd64/oras
# - bin/darwin/arm64/oras
make build-mac

# builds to bin/darwin/amd64/oras
make build-mac-amd64

# builds to bin/darwin/arm64/oras
make build-mac-arm64
```

Linux:

```bash
# builds to
# - bin/linux/arm64/oras
# - bin/linux/amd64/oras
# - bin/linux/arm/v7/oras
make build-linux

# builds to bin/linux/arm64/oras
make build-linux-arm64

# builds to bin/linux/amd64/oras
make build-linux-amd64

# builds to bin/linux/arm/v7/oras
make build-linux-arm-v7
```

Windows:

```bash
# builds to bin/windows/amd64/oras.exe
make build-windows
```

## Cleaning Your Workspace

To remove all files not managed by git, run `make clean` (be careful!)

## Managing Dependencies

[Using Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules) to manage dependencies.

To update or add new dependencies, run `go get <package name>`.
