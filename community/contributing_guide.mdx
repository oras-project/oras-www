Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to the ORAS project! 💖

As you get started, you are in the best position to give us feedback on areas of
our project that we need help with, including:

* Problems found during setting up a new developer environment
* Gaps in our Quickstart Guide or documentation
* Bugs in our automation scripts

If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a
bug report and let us know!

## Ways to Contribute

We welcome many types of contributions including:

* New features
* New end-to-end tests
* Bug fixes
* Documentation
* Issue triage
* Answering questions on our Slack channel
* Web design

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request. Please join our
[meetings](#join-our-meetings) or [contact us](#contact-us) and let's discuss
how we can work together.

### Join our Meetings

Absolutely everyone is welcome to come to any of our meetings. You never need an
invitation to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you don’t have
anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

Join the bi-weekly ORAS community meeting at 4:00 PM PST on [Zoom][zoom] with ID
807 932 8631. See the [meeting notes][meeting-notes] for agenda and past
meeting notes.

You don’t have to turn on your video. The first time you come, introducing
yourself is more than enough. Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable
voicing your opinions, giving feedback on others’ ideas, and even sharing your
own ideas, and experiences.

### Contact Us

Other than pull requests and GitHub issues, the best way to contact us is to
join us at the [CNCF Slack][cncf-slack] under the [**#oras** channel][slack].
You can find the steps in the
[community resources](/community/community_resources/#joining-the-slack-channel).

## Find an Issue

Each ORAS subproject has a label `good-first-issue` for issues that are
appropriate for new contributors. Each ORAS subproject has a label `help-wanted`
for issues suitable for someone who is ready to move onto after their first pull
request. For example, for the ORAS CLI project:

* [Good First Issues][good-first-issue]
* [Help Wanted][help-wanted-label]

Sometimes there won’t be any issues with these labels. That’s ok! There is
likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute, but you
don’t know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can ask in the
ORAS Slack channel.

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying
that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.

## Pull Request Lifecycle

Please remember that most contributors and maintainers of the project have
responsibilities outside this project and will review your pull request as time
allows. In general:

* If you have a pull request for a security vulnerability, please contact the
  maintainers directly before making your pull request public.
* Feature enhancement pull requests will likely take a week or more to get
  reviewed.
* Pull requests will be reviewed by at least two maintainers before being
  merged.
* If you are submitting a pull request that is a work in progress, mark it as a
  draft.
* If you have a pull request that is an urgent fix or effects the project
  widely, bring it up in the Slack channel.
* More details on the [review process][review-process].

## Development Environment Setup

The ORAS project contains several subprojects which use different build, test
and deployment methods. It is best to consult the project specific `README.md`
for development environment setup instructions. The first step for contribution
for any subproject would be to fork the repository on GitHub and then clone it
locally. For example:

```console
MY_GITHUB_NAME="my-name"
git clone git@github.com:${MY_GITHUB_NAME}/oras.git
cd oras
cat README.md
```

### For documentation

The recommendation is to follow [semantic line breaks][sembr].

## Sign Your Commits

All contributors to the project retain copyright to their work. However, to
ensure that they are only submitting work that they have rights to, we require
everyone to acknowledge this by signing their work. Any copyright notices in
this repo should specify the authors as "The ORAS Authors".

Licensing is important to open source projects. It provides some assurances that
the software will continue to be available based under the terms that the
author(s) desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to
our project's repositories. The [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)][dco] is
a way to certify that you wrote and have the right to contribute the code you
are submitting to the project.

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must
match the git user and email associated with the commit.

```console
    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>
```

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:

    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote
repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running

    git commit --amend -s

## Pull Request Checklist

When you submit your pull request, make sure the title follows the [conventional
commits specification][conventional-commits]. There is a formal [review
process][review-process] followed by contributors and maintainers.

When you submit your pull request, or you push new commits to it, our automated
systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request
passes these checks, but we also have more criteria than just that before we can
accept and merge it. We recommend that you check the following things locally
before you submit your code:

* [ ]  Does the affected code have corresponding tests, e.g. unit test, E2E
  test?
* [ ]  Does this change require a documentation update?
* [ ]  Does this introduce breaking changes that would require an announcement
  or bumping the major version?
* [ ]  Do all new files have an appropriate license header?
